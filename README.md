# ocaml-recursive-parser
An OCaml implementation of a recursive parser that constructs parse trees from grammars. The parser shares traversal techniques with a matcher function but faces challenges with left recursion and complex recursive structures. The project explores the limitations of recursion and backtracking in parsing
